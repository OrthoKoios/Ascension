# Known Bugs

* When there are many entities on the screen, the game may lag a bit. Further optimization may be required
* Hit boxes are not completely accurate - they are approximated with convenient shapes to use, such as circles or rectangles. Work on collision is needed.
  * These hit boxes include hit boxes for player, enemy, skills, portal, and buttons to navigate through the game.
* Explosion animations stay in place rather than following the enemy/player
  * For deaths, it is not a problem. But for targets that still live after being hit, the explosion will appear to move on the target's sprite, perhaps even moving off it, as the target can continue to move while the explosion does not.
* Enemy spawn is completely random, meaning that player can go quite a while without seeing an enemy.
